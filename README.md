# Hello

Set up my Mac.

* `install.sh` - let's go
* `mac.sh` - install macOS applications and packages with
[Homebrew](https://brew.sh).
* `vim.sh` set up Vim with config from [rafi](https://github.com/rafi/vim-config)

The installer also sets up configuration with stow.

* `git/` - global gitconfig and gitignore
* `vim/` - overriding vim configuration.
